# CHAPTER_4
Creating A Starter Project Template

By following the guide that contained in this chapter, I've created a starter project. Created a folders with the mkdir command and named them accordingly to out choosing name for the project to group them. I've learned to create two Dart files, and it's main.dart for out main() function and the home.dart that where we contain the code for the Home widget.
