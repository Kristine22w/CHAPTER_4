# CHAPTER_4
Creating A Starter Project Template

By following the guide in this chapter, I was able to create a starter project in Flutter. I started by organizing the project structure, creating folders using the mkdir command in the terminal, and naming them based on my chosen project setup. This helped me group and organize the files properly for better readability and structure.

I also learned how to create two Dart files: main.dart and home.dart. The main.dart file is where I defined the main() function, which is the entry point of the app. In the home.dart file, I wrote the code for the Home widget, which is where the main user interface for the app is built. Separating the files like this made the code more modular and easier to maintain, and it gave me a better understanding of how to structure a Flutter project efficiently.
